# Car-price-prediction-model
Overview
Ever wondered how much a car should really cost? This model helps predict car prices based on factors like brand, model, year, fuel type, and engine specifications. By analyzing past trends, it provides an estimated price range, making car buying or selling easier.

What It Does
Takes key details like car brand, model, year, and fuel type.
Cleans and processes the data to remove inconsistencies.
Uses machine learning to predict an estimated price.
Provides an easy-to-use interface for quick predictions.
How It Works
Enter details like brand, model, year, and fuel type.
The model analyzes historical data and predicts a fair price.
Get an instant estimate to make informed decisions.
Tools Behind the Magic
Python for coding the model.
Pandas & NumPy for handling data.
Scikit-learn for building machine learning models.
Matplotlib & Seaborn for visualizing price trends.
Flask/Django for making it accessible via a web app.
Future Improvements
